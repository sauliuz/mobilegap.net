> [mobilegap.net](https://www.mobilegap.net "list of open sourced mobile application projects") was a list of open source mobile application projects maintained via this github repository. this site has since been disolved, but we have left this project as a reference because several people starred it and got inspiration from it. This code is not actively maintained anymore.

[Metalsmith](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith) framework is used to build the HTML content out of the Markdown pages.

to test, clone this repository.

the following will build HTML pages in mobilegap.net directory (you must have [nodejs and npm installed](https://nodejs.org/en/))

    ./build-local.sh

add new links to [index.md](https://github.com/sauliuz/mobilegap.net/blob/master/markdown/index.md "add the link to your open source application") page and they will appear on the home page of HTML site after you perform a build based on step above.
